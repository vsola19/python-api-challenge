# python-api-challenge

Please note, I had run into many problems doing the 2nd part of the assignment, for vacation.py part, I struggled to produce the heat map for hotel part and maps.

Observations:
a)it can be seen that as temperatures get warmer, so do the cities that are closer to the equator, this is moderately positive correlation.

b)In additino, like warmer temps, those cities are closer to equator, are also likely to have higher humidity, another moderately positive correlation.

c) Southern hemisphere countries closey to equator are more likely to see cloudiness in their weather patterns.
